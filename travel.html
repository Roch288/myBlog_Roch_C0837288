              Nepal, the land of Himalayas, has got a lot to offer you from the warm hospitality of people to the
              charming natural
              beauty that it holds. From snow-capped mountains—including some of the highest mountains in the world—to
              the hill
              covered with luscious green trees and the plains, it has got it all. <br /><br />

              Individuals from all over the world come here to encounter such beauty along with the different activities
              that we
              offer. From all the activities, the terrain of the Himalayas can offer one with the best trekking routes.
              One can find
              the best route depending on their choice of difficulty. Trekking is certainly far from being comfortable,
              but in this
              madness, there is a certain kind of inexplicable joy, great traces of discomfort and a sort of
              satisfaction in the
              fight.<br /><br />

              With surfeit trekking trails leading to the scenic view of the snow-capped mountains, luscious forest
              followed by the
              never-ending streams, numerous trekking trails are yet to be discovered. One of them would be Pikey Peak
              Trek.<br /><br />

              Located in the Solukhumbu district of the Sagarmatha zone, Pikey Peak Trek is a newly discovered Everest
              region trekking
              route making it one of the less-traveled routes in the Everest region. The name of the mountain, Pikey,
              was derived from
              the local deity of the Sherpa Clan, representing the sky above nature.<br /><br />

              The trek will take you to the beautiful areas of the Everest region which is inhabited by the Sherpa
              people. Although
              Sagarmatha Zone is renowned for places such as Lukla Airport, Namche Bazar, Dingboche, and Sagarmatha
              National park,
              Pikey Peak is one of the best hilltop destinations to deliver panoramic views of Mount Everest and the
              region’s other
              surrounding peaks such as Lhotse, Makalu, and Mount Kanchenjunga. The view over the giant peaks of sunrise
              and sunset is
              so magical that it will become your memory for life.<br /><br />

              You can see tea houses lined up as you walk across the trail of Pikey. The standard and the comfort of the
              tea house
              depends on the location as you continue the journey up to Pikey. Rooms in these regions are drafty and
              they have no
              heating available, it would be better if you carry your sleeping bags. The staple food of Nepalese people
              is Dal Bhat,
              which includes rice, lentil soup, vegetable curry, and spinach and it is all you can eat. The availability
              of meat in
              remote and high altitudes will vary and is particularly scarce.<br /><br />
