            <p>
              The vibrant culture of the Newari community in Nepal has been praised time and again for their enormous
              celebrations of
              countless deities that rule the human existence and nature throughout the year. One of the festivals
              celebrated by the
              Newars that catches attention during Tihar, the festival of lights, is the tradition of Mha Puja. Mha Puja
              is the
              worship of self where the participants are said to worship one’s own body in order to cleanse their bodies
              and souls and
              ensure the longevity of the individuals.
            </p>

            <p>While the worship of various Hindu and Buddhist deities is not a new sensation, the worship of self-has a
              meaning that
              highlights the need of people to worship their bodies, the holder of their souls. Mha Puja is carried out
              on the fourth
              day of Tihar and shares the date with Nepal Sambat as well as Govardhan Puja. It is carried out as a
              prayer for the
              auspicious beginning of the Nepali/ Newari New Year. Worshiping oneself is a way of thanking one’s body
              and respecting
              it through the performance of a series of rituals that are considered to help in the cleansing of the body
              and soul of
              the participant. This helps to invoke prosperity and longevity of the worshipper. <br /><br />

              Mha Puja is carried out in the form of a ceremony where the members of the family sit in a row with
              mandalas painted on
              the floor for each member of the family. Two mandalas are also drawn for the messengers of death, in order
              to ensure
              they are satisfied and the family member’s longevity is increased. These mandalas are worshipped using
              various materials
              such as food, sacred thread, colored paste, incense, lighted wicks, and flowers. <br /><br />

              After the mandalas are worshipped, the family members sit before the mandalas and the lady of the
              household puts a dab
              of red paste on each member’s forehead. They are also given long incense sticks (khelu) and sacred threads
              (kwakha)
              along with fruits including citron. Next, a lady from the house offers dhau (yogurt) to the family
              member’s that they
              each dab on their temples. Ritual food including boiled egg, smoked fish and rice wine is then offered to
              the members.
              Rice wine must be taken by the members in a small pot three times in a row before placing the pot
              down.<br /><br />

              In the ceremony, the mandala represents the Universe, while the wick and incense stick is given to the
              participants with
              hopes that they will spread light and fragrance throughout the world. After the worship of the mandalas
              and the self,
              the members partake in a sumptuous feast. The feast is served on a bronze plate which is placed on the
              mandala, which
              destroys the design of the mandalas, signifying the impermanence of the world. The feast consists a mount
              of beaten rice
              in the center and eight other side dishes surrounding the rice. The feast is consumed and the dishes are
              left overnight
              and cleaned the next morning. In this manner, the Newars complete their annual ritual of worshiping the
              self.<br /><br />

              This old age tradition is a reflection of how the ancestors understood the importance of maintaining one’s
              body in order
              to live a healthy long life, something most of the newer generations have begun to forget given the rush
              of technology,
              unhealthy food habits and lack of interest in one’s own body due to the available distractions. One must,
              at all times,
              look after one’s body as a precious deity that has allowed our soul to experience the sensations of the
              world and hence,
              lovingly maintain the self, regardless of what cultural or ethnic background one belongs to.<br /><br />s
